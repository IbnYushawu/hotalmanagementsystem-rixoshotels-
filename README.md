## Technologies Used
Frontend:
React.js: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's known for its component-based architecture, which makes it easy to develop complex, interactive web applications. In the context of Rixos Hotels, React is used to create the client-facing user interface. It allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive web pages for clients to interact with, such as browsing rooms, managing bookings, and updating profiles.

Redux Thunk: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, often used with React. Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to handle asynchronous actions in Redux. In Rixos Hotels, Redux Thunk can be used to manage state and handle asynchronous actions, such as fetching room data from the server or managing user authentication.

Backend:
Node.js: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It is well-suited for building scalable and high-performance web applications. In the backend of Rixos Hotels, Node.js is used to handle server-side logic, user authentication, database interactions, and API endpoints.

Express.js: Express is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications by providing a range of useful features and middleware. In the context of Rixos Hotels, Express.js is used to create API endpoints, handle HTTP requests, and manage routing for different features like booking management and user authentication.

Database:
MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON. It's known for its scalability and ability to handle large amounts of data. In the Rixos Hotels system, MongoDB is used to store a variety of data, including user profiles, room details, booking records, and more. It allows for efficient data retrieval and manipulation, making it suitable for the complex data structure of a hotel management system.
Other:
JavaScript: JavaScript is the core programming language used throughout the entire application. It is responsible for the dynamic behavior of the frontend, the server-side logic in the backend, and interactions with the database.
The combination of these technologies provides a robust and modern software stack for building the Rixos Hotels Management System. React.js and Redux Thunk enable a dynamic and user-friendly frontend, while Node.js and Express.js power the backend to handle requests and manage data. MongoDB is the scalable data store that efficiently manages the diverse data requirements of the system. JavaScript ties it all together as the programming language of choice for this full-stack application
